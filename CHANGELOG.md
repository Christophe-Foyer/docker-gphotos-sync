Change Log
==========

Version 0.2.0 *(2020-05-10)*
----------------------------

 * New: `HEALTHCHECK_ID` replaces `CHECK_URL`. This allows the container to ping the check both
   before and after the sync which will report its execution time.

 * Fix: Update `gphotos-cbp` to latest which allows the tool to exit cleanly when it reaches the
   end of your photo library.


Version 0.1.0 *(2020-04-06)*
